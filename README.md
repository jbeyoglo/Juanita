Arduino Burner temperature control and mix. Dulce de leche cooking

The idea is to cut off power to the burner as soon as 
it reaches the target temperature. 
The temperature will continue raising, stabilize and 
finally start to fall, this algorithm will turn on 
the bruner when the temperature is half way between 
the higher point and the target temperature.
